## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (v0.1)
- Sync sends the entire buffer (not just diffs).
- Only the current buffer is synchronized.
- No support for multiple buffers or ghost cursors yet.

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Ghost cursor
- [ ] Multi-buffer support
- [ ] Built-in chat interface
- [ ] Optional WebRTC / TLS
- [ ] Review or read-only mode
